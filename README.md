# Opal

Opal is a collection of pretty QML components for SailfishOS, building on top
of Sailfish's Silica components.

This repository contains the Opal Gallery application which showcases all
modules. The module examples can be used as a starting point for new
applications.

You can find documentation on how to use Opal in other applications
[in the Wiki](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal). If you want to *use*
applications using Opal, you should not have to do anything.


## Development

1. Clone this repository e.g. to `src/opal/opal`
2. Run [libs/opal-fetch-modules.sh] to fetch the latest module sources
3. Open the project file [harbour-opal.pro] in the Sailfish OS IDE
4. Build an RPM package and install it on the target device


### Adding new modules

Please refer to [the Wiki](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal) for
documentation on how to include new modules in the gallery application.
