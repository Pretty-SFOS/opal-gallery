## Description

> free text with markup

<p>Opal is a collection of pretty QML components for SailfishOS, building on top of Sailfish's Silica components.</p>

<p><em>Opal Gallery</em> is an application which showcases all modules. The module examples can be used as a starting point for new applications.</p>

<p><strong>Project status</strong></p>

<p>There are currently two finished modules and a bunch of useful snippets that are well-tried in a handful of apps. The About page module and the icon rendering script are very useful for quick development. All modules are fully documented.</p>

<p><strong>How to use modules</strong></p>

<p>You can find documentation on how to use Opal in other applications <a href="https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal">in the main repo</a>.</p>

<p>The Opal Gallery application is released under the GNU GPL v3 or later, with source code available <a href="https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal-gallery">on Github</a>.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal/blob/main/README.md">Opal modules</a> have their own licensing. You can find more information about each module by opening their "About" pages in the Gallery app, or simply refer to the respective repositories.</p>
